  abstract      = "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive
                   performance in complex machine learning tasks such as image
                   classification or speech recognition. However, due to their
                   multi-layer nonlinear structure, they are not transparent,
                   i.e., it is hard to grasp what makes them arrive at a
                   particular classification or recognition decision given a
                   new unseen data sample. Recently, several approaches have
                   been proposed enabling one to understand and interpret the
                   reasoning embodied in a DNN for a single test image. These
                   methods quantify the ''importance'' of individual pixels wrt
                   the classification decision and allow a visualization in
                   terms of a heatmap in pixel/input space. While the
                   usefulness of heatmaps can be judged subjectively by a
                   human, an objective quality measure is missing. In this
                   paper we present a general methodology based on region
                   perturbation for evaluating ordered collections of pixels
                   such as heatmaps. We compare heatmaps computed by three
                   different methods on the SUN397, ILSVRC2012 and MIT Places
                   data sets. Our main result is that the recently proposed
                   Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm
                   qualitatively and quantitatively provides a better
                   explanation of what made a DNN arrive at a particular
                   classification decision than the sensitivity-based approach
                   or the deconvolution method. We provide theoretical
                   arguments to explain this result and discuss its practical
                   implications. Finally, we investigate the use of heatmaps
                   for unsupervised assessment of neural network performance.",

                 automated image classification systems is of high value in
                 many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the
                 system and provides additional information to the human
                 expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very
                 successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the
                 disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any
                 information about what made them arrive at a particular
                 decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem
                 of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise
                 decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a
                 methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of
                 single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over
                 Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks.
                 These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and
                 are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only
                 verify the validity of the classification decision, but also
                 focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We

                   techniques, based on computing the gradient of the class

                   generates an image, which maximises the class score [Erhan

                   captured by a ConvNet. The second technique computes a class

  abstract    = "Learning to store information over extended time intervals by
                 recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly
                 because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly
                 review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then
                 address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based
                 method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the
                 gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge
                 minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by
                 enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels
                 within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open
                 and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in
                 space and time; its computational complexity per time step and
                 weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve
                 local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern
                 representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent
                 learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade
                 correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM
                 leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster.
                 LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that

                   object recognition are built using the same principles:
                   Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a
                   small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the
                   state of the art for object recognition from small images
                   with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of
                   different components in the pipeline. We find that
                   max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer
                   with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several
